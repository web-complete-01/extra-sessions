## CHALLENGE 1: Number Relations
Create a program takes a numeric value from the user and displays:
1. In a single message, a sequence of text containing: the previous number, the given number, and the next number (e.g., 5 => "4, 5, 6").
2. The opposite of the number (e.g., 5 => "the opposite of 5 is -5", -3 => "the opposite of -3 is 3").
3. The remainder of the division by 2 (e.g., 5 => "the remainder of 5 divided by 2 is 1").
4. Number 2 raised to the power of the given value (e.g., 3 => "2 to the power of 3 is 8").
