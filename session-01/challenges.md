# SEQUENTIAL ALGORITHMIC CHALLENGES

## CHALLENGE 1: Number Relations
Create a program takes a numeric value from the user and displays:
1. In a single message, a sequence of text containing: the previous number, the given number, and the next number (e.g., 5 => "4, 5, 6").
2. The opposite of the number (e.g., 5 => "the opposite of 5 is -5", -3 => "the opposite of -3 is 3").
3. The remainder of the division by 2 (e.g., 5 => "the remainder of 5 divided by 2 is 1").
4. Number 2 raised to the power of the given value (e.g., 3 => "2 to the power of 3 is 8").

**Example** 
```
Input: 5

Output: 
    4, 5, 6  
    The opposite of 5 is -5  
    The remainder of 5 divided by 2 is 1  
    2 to the power of 5 is 32  
```

## CHALLENGE 2: Basic Arithmetic Operations
The user enters two numeric values. The program displays:
1. Their sum,
2. Their difference,
3. Their product,
4. Their division,
5. Their arithmetic mean,
6. The remainder of the division of the first number by the second,
7. The first number raised to the power of the second.

**Example** 
```
Input: 
    First number: 4
    Seond number: 2

Output: 
    Sum: 6  
    Difference: 2  
    Product: 8  
    Quotient: 2  
    Arithmetic Mean: 3  
    Remainder: 0  
    4 to the power of 2 is 16 
```


## CHALLENGE 3: Final Grade Calculation
A student receives three grades. The program calculates and displays the final average.

**Example** 
```
Input: 
    First grade: 7.5
    Second grade: 8.5
    Third grade: 9.5

Output: 
    Final grade: 8.5  
```

## CHALLENGE 4: Next Term in Arithmetic Progression
The user enters two numbers in an arithmetic sequence. The program calculates and displays the next number in the sequence.

**Example** 
```
Input: 
    First number: 3
    Second number: 6

Output: 
    The next number in the sequence is: 9  
```


## CHALLENGE 5: Currency Conversion
The user enters an amount in one currency and an exchange rate. The program calculates and displays the converted amount.

**Example** 
```
Input: 
    Amount: 100  
    Exchange rate: 4.5

Output: 
    Converted amount: 450   
```


## CHALLENGE 6: Dice Roll Simulation
The program generates and displays a random number between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of a six-sided die.

**Example** 
```
Input:
    - no input required

Output: 
    You rolled: 4
```
